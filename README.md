## 4. Project Description
A student who finishes his / her studies at NITK might want to sell  or give away books, printers etc. But finding a suitable recipient quickly might not be easy. We would like to develop a solution to address this problem and make the process smooth.

Objective: Develop a portal that gives information about sellers and prospective buyers and match one to the other.
