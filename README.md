## 4. Project Description
A student who finishes his / her studies at NITK might want to sell  or give away books, printers etc. But finding a suitable recipient quickly might not be easy. We would like to develop a solution to address this problem and make the process smooth.

Objective: Develop a portal that gives information about sellers and prospective buyers and match one to the other.

## 5. Motivation
NITK students who will leave the campus in a month or a week. It’s not possible for them to carry out all their belongings back home. Instead, they want to sell them. Let’s say books. The students who are leaving the campus may not require some books and would like to give them to their juniors or freshers at a reasonable price. There are many things other than books. Accessories like Keyboard, Extension Boxes, LAN cables, Printers, and Room essentials like mattresses, Buckets, Hangers, and Stationery (Drafters), etc… and umbrellas.
  
It's not easy for them to search for a suitable person who wants to buy or sell  those things unless they know it through some media. Also It is not possible for the student to ask every other student if they are willing to buy or sell the things. Also, the students who leave the college in a couple of days want to find the buyers at the earliest possible.

## 6. proposed solution
To address this problem, our team came up with the best solution for the intra-college students. A portal is built for the students, where they can request and post things which they would like to buy and sell respectively. Once we find any buyer-seller pair, they can contact each other and get the things transferred. 

In detail, the student who wants to buy, can request the items from the specific list of things the portal provides. Similarly, the student can post the items one would like to sell. The student has to wait until he finds the person to buy or sell. If there are no other buyers for the item, the student can give those items to the Co-operative Society at a fixed price. Rest is handled by the Co-Operative Society. And if the buyer didn’t satisfy with the item or didn’t find the item for a long time and buy that new item, the buyer can withdraw his request anytime. Like wise the seller can also give it to Co-Operative society at any time.

## 7.Related Work
There are few existing solutions to this problem. But they are not effective. Some online platforms like OLX allow users to post the items. But, it has very less reach for the items like buckets, LAN cables, etc… on such platforms and this problem can easily be solved if the buyers and sellers are of similar interest like within neighbourhood, school, etc…
In such platforms, usually we need to wait for the buyer to approach us. This keeps the seller wait for hours, days, even months. In the problem statement, the student wants to sell them quickly. For which we added a feature for the buyers to request the item forehand. 

Even when buyer is found and he is at far distance, it might not be worthy enough to travel to deliver the item. To prevent this, we restrict this solution only to the students inside the college.
